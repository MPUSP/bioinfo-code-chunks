bioinfo-code-chunks
================================
Michael Jahn

Random selection of useful code chunks and examples for bioinformatics.

This repository is a collection of reusable, self-contained code chunks and examples. The goal is to provide code examples for recurring tasks, that require mostly existing packages and therefore do not fulfill the requirements to become a new package.

### Structure

- `data`: raw data tables or files used for examples
- `docs`: rendered notebooks in `html` format, for example from R markdown
- `source`: notebooks and raw script files

### Contents

- [Hypergeotric test for gene enrichment (R)](https://m-jahn.github.io/bioinfo-code-chunks/hypergeometric-test.nb.html)
